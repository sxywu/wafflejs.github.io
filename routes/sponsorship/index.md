About
-----
WaffleJS is a monthly meetup centered around programming, waffles, and karaoke.
It started when Visnu and Billy went to [BrooklynJS][brooklynjs]. They were inspired by
the event and wanted to organize a Bay Area technology meetup that would do
these things:

- Have attendees actually meet and talk to one another.
- Promote a diverse and inclusive environment.
- Get people to have fun.

Today the meetup is co-organized by [Visnu][@visnup], [Billy][@billyroh], [Kelly][@kng], [Emily][@nexxylove], [Brian][@b11z], [Max][@chromakode], [Katrina][@kuychaco], and [Michelle][@binarymuse].
It's held at [SoMa StrEat Food Park][map] every first Wednesday of the month.

- **Stage time:**
  Two minutes of stage time to do whatever you want with (the more creative the
  better).
- **Free tickets:**
  Two tickets for people at your company (please, no recruiters).
- **Swag and merch:**
  Place to put stickers and swag on the check-in desk or on tables around the
  venue.
- **Branding:**
  Featured in the emails to the attendees and shown on wafflejs.com.
- **Opt-in email list:**
  We ask all attendees whether they'd like to be contacted by sponsors. We'll
  share the contact information of those (and only those) who have opted in.
- **Brunch:**
  Every three months, we invite sponsors, speakers and performers to have
  [brunch][brunch] together.

History
-------
The first session was in August 2015 and it has been held monthly ever since.
We use funds to cover the cost of food, the venue, and equipment. We donate
all unused funds each month to non-profits such as [Girls Who Code][girlswhocode] and
[Black Girls Code][blackgirlscode].

Our attendees are roughly the same ratio of people from larger and smaller

Diversity
---------
We believe this industry can and should be more inclusive. Here are the things
we do to make that happen:

- **Donations:**
  We donate all proceeds to non-profits such as [Girls Who Code][girlswhocode] and
  [Black Girls Code][blackgirlscode].
- **Student sponsorships:**
  We sponsor students to come to the event so they can meet more people in the
  industry. So far, we’ve had students from Waterloo, Stanford, Hackbright, and
  Hack Reactor.
- **Diverse speakers:**
  We make sure that we have a wide range of speakers at each of our events,
  with an eye toward gender, racial, and socioeconomic diversity.
